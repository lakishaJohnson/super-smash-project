# Super Smash Bros. Melee API Project

Hi everyone! I wanted you to have an extra project to work on during the week long break. This project will help solidify some of the things we learned in Module Two. It's meant to help you practice the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills you have gained so far.

## Are there tests? Do I have to npm install?

Nope! There are no tests. Just try to get the basic functionality seen here in this deployed version of the project: https://samshapland22.github.io/super-smash-character-picker/

There's currently NO CSS at all. I'll probably add some CSS in the coming days, so you can check back using that link to see updates and get ideas for how to style it. The important thing for now is that you get the basic functionality down, then add your own styling later!

## How do I get started?

I added an assets folder for you to drag and drop saved images into, just in case you'd like to add an image or two to your project.

I also added a script.js file to outline what the steps of this project are. The rest is up to you to build from scratch. You'll need to create an index.html file and a style.css file, and make sure to connect everything in the head of your index.html file.

Happy coding! Feel free to reach out if you have questions, we will have regular office hours next week.
